This Telephone Number Validator project was created as a certification requirement for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course from freeCodeCamp. The objective was to build an application that validates US phone numbers based on various acceptable formats. The app meets the required functionalities, providing a user-friendly interface to input a phone number and receive feedback on its validity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is part of the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course. Although freeCodeCamp provides guidelines and user stories for certification projects, it does not offer tutorials or step-by-step guides for development. This project was built entirely from scratch using my own approach to meet the requirements.

## üìù Project Objective

The primary objective of this project was to create a telephone number validator application that accurately determines the validity of US phone numbers. The goal was to implement an app that can handle various phone number formats, including those with or without country codes, different separators, and parentheses. The design and functionality reflect personal choices while sticking to the user stories provided.

## üîß Features

- **Input Field**: An `input` element with id `user-input` for users to enter a phone number.

- **Check Button**: A `button` element with id `check-btn` that triggers the validation check.

- **Clear Button**: A `button` element with id `clear-btn` to reset the results and input field.

- **Result Display**: A `div` element with id `results-div` that shows whether the entered phone number is valid or invalid.

- **Validation and Alerts**: Alerts and result messages are displayed based on the input's validity, with appropriate styling changes for visual feedback.

- **Phone Number Validation**: Utilizes regular expressions to validate phone number formats and ensure the correct country code.

## üìñ Learnings

- **Regex**: Gained more experience applying regular expressions to validate various US phone number formats and handle different input scenarios.

- **String Manipulation**: Utilized JavaScript for processing and validating user input.

- **Event Handling**: Implemented event listeners to handle user interactions and trigger validation checks.

- **Styling**: Enhanced user experience with visual feedback based on input validity.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring the application.

- **CSS3** for styling and providing visual feedback.

- **JavaScript** for functionality, including regex validation and DOM manipulation.

## üí° Acknowledgments
